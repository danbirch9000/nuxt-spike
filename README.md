# nuxt-spike

> My beautiful Nuxt.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

#
To run locally amend common/auth.js to change isProd flag to false.

This will point the auth service at localhost:1337

Fire up firebase project /Users/dan/Workspace/firebase

and run cd functions / node index
